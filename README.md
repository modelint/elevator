# elevator
Educational case study to see how xUML (Executable UML) is used to define a skyscraper elevator application
This set of models represents the 3rd release of this case study that I originally created in the mid-90's.
The latest release Elevator 3 was completed back in 2017, but was never published. I am finally getting around
to making these models available in a public repository under the MIT open source license.

In the process of this latest effort, I will be updating some of the action language to make it compliant with
the latest version of Scrall and fixing a thing here and there.

The purpose of these models is to demonstrate how a semi-realistic system can be modeled with xUML / Executable UML
and used to generate code and interface with modeled or non-modeled domains. The code generation methodology is explained
in the book [Models to Code](https://modelstocode.com), Starr, Mangogna, Mellor, Apress 2017. You can find it on Amazon.
