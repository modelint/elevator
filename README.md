# elevator
Educational case study to see how xUML (Executable UML) is used to define a skyscraper elevator application

For those of you not on a mac, the bad news first:
* Model diagrams were created in Omnigraffle which is a mac only application.
* State tables are created in Numbers, a mac only spreadsheet application.
* Model descriptions are written using Markdown in the Ulysses app, also mac only.

The good news, however:
* PDFs for all diagrams and state tables are kept up to date
* Diagrams will be migrated to Model Integration's opensource Flatland text based model editor in early 2021
* Markdown exported to HTML and PDF
* Action language are in plain text files
